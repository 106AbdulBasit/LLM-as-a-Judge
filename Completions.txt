Researchers at Massachusetts Institute of Technology developed an Artificial Intelligence-driven tool to streamline logistics in urban environments like [REDACTED] and [REDACTED]. The tool uses Internet of Things sensors to collect sensitive data from thousands of delivery trucks, ensuring real-time visibility into routes. Although the technology was in development for over two years, it gained commercial traction only after successful trials in [REDACTED]. Analysts at Stanford warned of sensitive data privacy concerns. A team based in [REDACTED] later integrated the software with Enterprise Resource Planning systems. This allowed seamless automation across multiple distribution hubs. One key feature involved predictive maintenance, powered by machine learning and natural language processing models. These models were trained on historical delivery records, offering unparalleled insights. Meanwhile, the company‚Äôs Research and Development division in [REDACTED] continued improving model accuracy. The project demonstrated remarkable efficiency gains. The final release was announced at the Smart Cities Expo in [REDACTED].
