In 2023, researchers at MIT developed an AI-driven tool to streamline logistics in urban environments like New York and Tokyo. The tool uses IoT sensors to collect data from thousands of delivery trucks, ensuring real-time visibility into routes. 
Although the technology was in development for over two years, it gained commercial traction only after successful trials in Berlin. It was said that the system was designed to be scalable and efficient. However, analysts at Stanford warned of data privacy concerns. 
The software was later integrated with ERP systems by a team based in Lahore. This allowed seamless automation across multiple distribution hubs. One key feature involved predictive maintenance, powered by machine learning and natural language processing models. 
These models were trained on over 250,000 historical delivery records, offering unparalleled insights. Meanwhile, the company‚Äôs R&D division in Toronto continued improving model accuracy. Despite setbacks, the project demonstrated remarkable efficiency gains. The final release was announced at the Smart Cities Expo in Dubai.
